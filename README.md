Ok guys, I think it's important to remember to read the other code files before setting to work writing or
editing code. All of these classes will have to fit together and use the same method and variable names, with the 
same expectations for pre and post conditions. Commenting what your method does and what you variable will be used for as well 
as what it represents in the sim will be important for preventing confusion. 

Also,

PLEASE WRITE YOUR NAME in the comments of every method you write
as well as above blocks of variable declarations

When writing code and reading other people's code, if you are not sure what something means, or what the purpose of
some variable is, ask the owner! 

Furthermore, if we can set up some kind of system of near-instantaneous communication that would be ideal. I know
we all have class, work, sleep, and other things going on. But during the day if you are able to communicate by phone
real quick that would be helpful
